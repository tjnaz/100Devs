# Learning with the #100Devs Community

Welcome to my personal repository! This repo serves as a space for me to store and organize my notes, learning resources, and projects as I learn web development with the [#100Devs community](https://www.twitch.tv/leonnoel) led by Leon Noel.

## About This Repo

As I progress through the #100Devs curriculum and live streams, I will be adding new notes, code examples, and resources that I find valuable. This repo includes a `100Devs-projects` directory, which contains submodules for various projects that I work on during my learning journey.

## Structure

The repo is organized into folders for each topic covered in the #100Devs curriculum. Within each folder, you'll find separate files for notes, code examples, and additional resources.
